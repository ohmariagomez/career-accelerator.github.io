## What if one's environment is not very supportive?
In the scenario where someone’s environment is not supportive of risk taking or if the person doesn’t feel comfortable with risks early in their career, they can still use strategies to create their own micro-environment to act as a safety net for taking risks.

Below are some strategies for seeking out your own micro-environment:
* Finding mentors to create this environment
* Engaging your manager in a conversation about your interests so they can help you find opportunities to learn on the job
* Lean on colleagues who listen to your opinions and celebrate your wins, no matter how small
* Practice continuous learning to help you identify an interest you feel passionate about and can learn on the side of your core responsibilities
